# Hack-a-LOD - The Hacking Historians app

This app uses React together with webpack as build tool. It follows a component based structure.

To get the app running after cloning it type:
``` npm run prepare ```

To start the server:
``` npm run dev ```

To create a deployable build:

What the app should do is for the hackathon.
