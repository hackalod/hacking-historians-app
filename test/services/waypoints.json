A project should be able to grow easily, for example by adding new features. \nIn order for numerous team members to collaborate, a team should be able to  easily share their work. Web components are a good way to enforce  collaboration, because you can add features by simply importing a component.  This method also results in clean and readable code. With scalability and  maintainability in mind, components can be combined, stacked or replaced. \nMost importantly because components are completely encapsulated,  it provides an easy way to share and reuse code. Working with web components is not only about creating your own custom elements but also about  incorporating other people's custom elements. Why create something that has  already been created? Instead of just collaborating with your team why not  share your components with the world? \nIn a very short time, this idea has already generated an active community that shares their components. There are many custom elements available; one could build an entire web application just from external components.\n","summary":"Web components provide an easy way to share and reuse code. \n","version":"1.0.0","title":"Custom Elements","contributors":[],"curator_org":"University of Amsterdam","curator":"yeehaa"},{"id":"553d7394e46810232b3ae65b","created":"2015-04-26T23:24:04.564Z","checkpoints":[{"id":"45","description":"Numbers are at the core of programming, not just webprogramming, but all programming.
